INTRODUCTION

Image completion method aim to repair the defects of digital images
with plausibly synthesized content to make images look more natural. Image
completion is one of the technologies used to fill in missing parts of images.
The generated contents can either be as accurate as the original, or simply fit
well within the context such that the completed image appears to be visually
realistic. It is important to find ways to repair the defects. For example, a
face image captured by a camera may be occluded by other objects, resulting
in loss of face information. This undoubtedly increases the difficulty of face
recognition. While face completion can repair the missing face information
and generate a complete face to improve the accuracy of face recognition. To
solve this problem, we propose a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Network (DCGAN) which is a deep learning-based model that automatically
completes the missing region so that the completed face not only looks natural
and realistic but also has consistency with the rest of the image.

BACKGROUND

DCGAN is an approach for generative modeling using deep learning
methods such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Generative modeling
is an unsupervised learning approach that involves automatically discovering
and learning patterns in input data such that the model can be used to generate
new examples from the original dataset. There are two components of GANs:
Generator: It is trained to generate new dataset, for example in computer vision
it generates new images from existing real-world images. Discriminator: It
compares those images with some real-world examples and classify real and
fake images.
